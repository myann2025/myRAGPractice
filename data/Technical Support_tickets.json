        "body": "Hello Customer Support, \\n\\nI am experiencing an issue with the synchronization of our digital campaign data, which seems to happen sporadically. I suspect it may be due to software updates that are currently incompatible, leading to conflicts. I have already attempted to restart the servers, adjust the adapter settings, and clear the database cache, yet the problem continues. \\n\\nCould you please look into this and provide a solution urgently? The unpredictable nature of the issue complicates efforts to identify the exact cause and is potentially impacting our campaign's performance. Although I have attempted to resolve the issue independently, I believe your assistance is required. \\n\\nIf you need any additional information from me, please let me know. I am looking forward to your prompt response. Thank you for your assistance.",
